# ML is used in different sectors like 
# Self-driving Cars, Robotics, Language Processing, Vision Processing, 
# Forecast Stock Market Trends, Games and so on.

# Steps:
# 1. Import the data [CSV file]
# 2. Clean the data [If not done, produce wrong results, 
#                     remove duplicate, organize, etc]
# 3. Split the data into Training and Test Sets
# 4. Create a model [No need to do anything from scratch, 
#                    libraries out there, here scikit-learn is used]
# 5. Train the model
# 6. Make predictions
# 7. Evaluate and improve


# Popular libraries
# 1. Numpy - provides a multidimensional array
# 2. Pandas - data analysis library, provide a concept called data frame.
# A data frame is two dimensional data structure similar to an excel sheet,
# we have rows and columns.
# 3. MatPlotLib - 2D plotting library for craeting graphs and plots.
# 4. Scikit Learn - Popular ML library, provides common algos like 
# decision tress, neural networks, and so on.

# Note => We can editors for ML projects but its not ideal to use. Technically Jupyter
# works well because we need to inspect the data frequently and that is really 
# hard in environments like vs code and terminal. If you are working on huge 
# data visalizing this in terminal or editor is really difficult and messy. 
# Hence we use Jupyter.
